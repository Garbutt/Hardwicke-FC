      The new and official website for Hardwicke FC has now launched bringing
      you information on the team, players and coaches. This is version 3.0 of
      the website offering new features like the "Blog" and design updates. The
      website has also being built using a framework called Astro which ensures
      the site runs smoothly and responsively. Build 1.0 and 2.0 both had major
      improvements from the last but still had many bug issues which have been
      fixed in 3.0.<br /><br /> The website started being developed in December
      of 2022 and has went through many stages since.
