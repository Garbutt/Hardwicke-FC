      Hardwicke FC win the treble in 2023 after a nail biting season. We won the
      Premier A, Liddy Cup and the Aul challenge cup. The players involved had
      an exeptional season and Hardwicke is the second team to win the treble in
      years. This ultimately led to Hardwicke FC winning the club of the year
      for the 22/23 season.
